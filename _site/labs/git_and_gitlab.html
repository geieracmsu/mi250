xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Your own git repository </h1> <p>In the readings, you read about version control and git. A repository is a specific, named collection of files that usually make up a single program. You’ve already used a git repository without really knowing it; all of the files for last week’s lab were stored in a git repository, which you accessed through a webpage (GitLab).</p> <p>Today, the first thing you are going to do is to get your OWN copy of the repository on your computer.</p> <h2 id="make-a-copy-for-your-pair-only-do-once"> <a href="#make-a-copy-for-your-pair-only-do-once" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="make-a-copy-for-your-pair-only-do-once"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Make a copy for your pair (only do once) </h2> <p>At the top of this page, there is a link to this week’s GitLab project. Click on that link and open it in a new window. What opens is a web interface to MY project on GitLab. GitLab is a system hosted by MSU that allows you to create new projects. Each project in GitLab has a git repostoriy in it. GitLab allows you to share them with other people as much as you want, for free. One of you will have to log into GitLab with your NetID and password in order to be able to see the project and repository.</p> <p>The webpage you see represents a GitLab project. If you look around, you can see that there are files in that project. Those files are in the repository that is inside the project. Each project has one repository that contains the files for the project. There are also a lot of controls along the left side of the web page that allow you to do things like see the activity on the project, report bugs (“issues”) in the code, or change settings. There is a “history” button on the top right that allows you to see every change I’ve ever made to that project. (Click it!)</p> <p>This first thing we are going to do is to <strong>fork</strong> the project. Forking a project means making a wholely new project that is a copy of this project. It creates its own copy of the repository/files and also copies its own settings and everything about it.</p> <p>To do this, look for the “fork” button along the top of the webpage, and click that. It will ask you for a ‘namespace’; there should be only one option, with your name. Click on that to start the forking. Forking will take a moment. Once it finishes, then it will take you to the new project. The new project should look almost the same as the original – it is a copy, after all! The main difference is if you look at the top, instead of saying “MI-250 / Git and Gitlab”, it should say your name now. If it does, then great! It worked! If not, then ask the instructor or TA for some assistance. (Sometimes you may get a 404 Error page. That happens when forking is slow. Just wait a minute and hit “refresh” and it usually fixes itself.)</p> <p>The first thing you should do after forking a project is to give your pair partner access to the project. To do this, click on settings on the left, and then go to “members”. This is the page where you can give other people access. Find your partner’s name in the search bar. Then change the “role permission” to “Maintainer” – the highest level of permissions. Then click “add to project” This will add them to the project.</p> <p>Next, the navigator (who was just added to the project) should try to log into Gitlab <a href="https://gitlab.msu.edu">https://gitlab.msu.edu</a> and click on “Projects” -&gt; “Your Projects”. She or he should see the “Git and Gitlab” project on the list, and be able to click on it and view it.</p> <p>Congrats! You’ve now got your first GitLab project! Good work!</p> <h2 id="set-up-your-computer-to-use-the-new-git-repository"> <a href="#set-up-your-computer-to-use-the-new-git-repository" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="set-up-your-computer-to-use-the-new-git-repository"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Set up your computer to use the new git repository </h2> <p>You’ve now got your own project, but right now it only exists on GitLab. That’s great – it is on a webpage where others can see it also. But it is hard to work with it on a webpage. All of the programming work you’ve done in this class is on your personal computer. It is difficult to do programming on a webpage.</p> <p>To work with on your computer, we need to get a copy of the <em>repository</em> – the files stored inside the project. To do that, we will use git.</p> <h3 id="install-git"> <a href="#install-git" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="install-git"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Install Git </h3> <p>The first thing you’ll need to do is download and install Git onto your computer. You can do that from the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Downloads Page</a>. Do that now. If you are on a Mac, choose the “Binary Installer”</p> <p>On Windows, it will ask you a lot of questions. Just click next on ALMOST all of them. There is one question – What do you want your default editor to be? – that you need to answer. Click on the dropdown and choose the text editor that you use for editing in this class. On Mac, it won’t ask this.</p> <p>Once you’ve got that installed, open up a command line window (either Powershell or Terminal). If you just type the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>, it should print out a bunch of help information about the different git commands. If it does that, then you’ve got git installed correctly! If you get an error message, then you didn’t install git correctly yet.</p> <p>The first thing we need to do is to set up git by telling it who we are and what editor we use. Use the following two commands to tell it who you are, substituting your name and email address for mine:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config --global user.name "Rick Wash"
git config --global user.email "wash@msu.edu"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Be sure to keep the quotation marks. You should only need to do this once on your computer; after that, it will remember who you are.</p> <h4 id="mac-os"> <a href="#mac-os" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="mac-os"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Mac OS </h4> <p>Next, only for Mac OS, we need to tell git what text editor we use. This is harder on Macs than on Windows. On Windows, you already told it what editor to use when you installed it. So skip this section; you only have to do this if you didn’t tell git what editor to use.</p> <p>On Mac, there isn’t a good text editor built in, so we need to tell it to use the one you installed during Week 0.</p> <p>If you use BBedit, then click on the BBEdit menu in the upper left corner, and choose “Install Command Line Tools”. After that is done, then run this command to tell git to use BBedit:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If you use VS Code, then goto the menu and find “Install ‘Code’ command in path”. Once you choose that, then run this command on the command line to tell git to use VS Code:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
</code></pre></div></div> <h3 id="create-a-gitlab-access-token"> <a href="#create-a-gitlab-access-token" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="create-a-gitlab-access-token"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Create a GitLab Access Token </h3> <p>Gitlab recently changed to not allow passwords. Instead, you need to use something called an “Access Token” instead of your NetID and password. To create an access token, go back to the GitLab webpage and click on the image in the upper right hand corner of the page and choose “Preferences” for your user. Then, on the page that appears, in the menu on the left, choose “Access Tokens”. On this page, you can create an access token, which is basically a temporary password for you to use.</p> <p>Type in your NetID in the “Token Name” field. Then choose an expiration date that is sometime after May 2023. It is important that you click the “write_repository” checkbox, because that allows this password to access your repositories. Then click the “Create personal access token” button. The webapge will reload, and near the top, it will print out a new “access token” which is basically a randomly generated password for you to use.</p> <p><strong>Write down this access token</strong>. (Or copy-and-paste it somewhere you can find it.)</p> <p>You should only need to do the access token thing today; after completing this lab, git should remember it and never ask you again.</p> <h3 id="fork-and-clone-the-repository"> <a href="#fork-and-clone-the-repository" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="fork-and-clone-the-repository"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Fork and Clone the Repository </h3> <p>On your computer, you should make a place to keep your work for this class – all of the labs and studios that you work on. Me, personally, I created a folder on my desktop called “MI 250” and keep everything in there. But its your computer, and you can put it whereever you want.</p> <p>To work with a repository on your computer, you need to “clone” the repository – which means that we need to download the repository onto your personal computer so you can work with it. First, let’s set up your computer to be ready to clone. Open up a command line (using either Terminal (Mac OS) or PowerShell (Windows), as we did last week). Then change directories to the directory where you want to keep your files using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command. Remember, like last week, you can drag a directory from Explorer/Finder onto the command line, and it will type in that directory name for you onto the command line.</p> <p>If you are using an MI 250 folder on your desktop like I do, then the command to change directories is</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd Desktop/MI\ 250
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If you look at <em>your</em> project page on GitLab, in the upper right hand corner there is a blue button labled “Clone”. If you click on that, you get two options: “Clone with SSH” and “Clone with HTTPS”. Those are just two different ways of accomplishing the same thing. In this class, we are going to use the 2nd option: “Clone with HTTPS”. Click the button next to that option, and it will copy a link to the repository onto your clipboard.</p> <p>Next, we want to use the command line to actually clone the project. By default, this command will clone the project into whatever directory you are currently in on the command line. That’s why it was important that we <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into our folder for this class before running this command.</p> <p>Use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> to clone the project. On the command line, type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone </code> and then paste in the link that you copied from the Gitlab website. It should look something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://gitlab.msu.edu/wash/git-and-gitlab.git
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When you do this, it will ask you for your username and password. Don’t enter your real password! Instead, Log in with your NetID (don’t include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@msu.edu</code>) and then use your newly created “access token” as the password. If this works, then it should print out information telling you it is “receiving objects”, which means it is downloading the files for the repository for you.</p> <p>Once it has downloaded, you will get a prompt on the command line again. If you use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, you should see a new directory called “git-and-gitlab”. Change directories into that using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd git-and-gitlab</code>. If you do an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> again, you’ll see that all of the files from the repository have now been downloaded onto your computer and are there for you to work with. If you look at the folder in Exporer/Finder, then you should also see the files.</p> <h2 id="make-a-change"> <a href="#make-a-change" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="make-a-change"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Make a change </h2> <p>Next, let’s make a change. Open up the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> in your text editor. Right now, it has my name (Rick Wash) in there as the author. That’s not longer true – this is YOUR repository now! Change the name to your name.</p> <h2 id="commit-and-push-the-change"> <a href="#commit-and-push-the-change" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="commit-and-push-the-change"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Commit and Push the change </h2> <p>Now, you’ve change the file on your local computer. But if you go look at the file in the repository on GitLab, it still has my name in it. That is because you haven’t committed or pushed your change; that is, you haven’t made the change official. Git has this idea that you can edit lots of files, and try lots of things out, but it is only when you make something official that it actually gets recorded and put into the repository. And this process of making things official is something you have to do by hand, intentionally.</p> <p>Doing this has three steps: add, commit, and push. Each of these steps is important, so let’s walk through them.</p> <h4 id="add"> <a href="#add" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="add"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Add </h4> <p>Start by running the status command on the command line:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git status
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This command will show you the current status of the local clone of your git repository that is on your computer. It will let you know if any files have been modified since the last version you got, and if any files have been added or deleted. You should see that you’ve modified the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file.</p> <p>The first step is to let git know what changes go together. Sometimes you make changes in multiple different files, and you want all of those changes to logically go together as one commit. To do this, git has what it calls a “staging area” – a place you put changes until you’ve got the whole set of them together. You use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code> to add things to this staging area. You can run this command multiple times if you want to add changes from more than one file to the same commit.</p> <p>We only have one file with changes – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> – so we only need to add one file to the staging area. Let’s do so with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code> command:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add README.md
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If this works correctly, then it won’t print anything out. It will just give you a new prompt. If it doesn’t work, then you’ll get an error message.</p> <p>Note: On many systems, the filename is case sensitive; so if you get an error message, try to make sure the case is correct.</p> <h4 id="commit"> <a href="#commit" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="commit"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Commit </h4> <p>Once you’ve got all the changes together in the staging area, the next step is to “commit” those changes. Committing the changes takes all those changes, and creates a new version of your program that has those changes. That is, it formally records that these changes compromise a new version of your program.</p> <p>To do this, we use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When you type “git commit” and hit enter, your default text editor should open up. A new file will open up in your text editor. Type the commit message on the first line of the file. SAVE and CLOSE the file! Once you do this, the commit should go through in PowerShell/Terminal.</p> <p>When you run that command, then git will ask you for a message. This is a description what changes you are making. This description becomes an official part of the record – you can sit it in GitLab by looking at the History of the repository. It is important to put a good, descriptive message here so that you – future you – can remember what changes you made and why you made them.</p> <p>When you close the window with the commit message, git should complete the commit.</p> <p>If a file doesn’t open when you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, then look at the Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this page.</p> <h4 id="push"> <a href="#push" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="push"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Push </h4> <p>Committing the changes only records the changes in the clone of the repository that is on your computer. If you look at Gitlab, your changes haven’t made it to the main repository yet. That’s what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> does – it takes any changes that are on your current computer that you’ve committed, and it pushes them up to the main repository on Gitlab. Run that command now:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now go check the main Gitlab page. Don’t forget to refresh the page. When you look at the README.md file, it should have your name in it now instead of my name. That means that you have successfully commited your first change to a git repository! Good work!</p> <h2 id="swap-and-repeat"> <a href="#swap-and-repeat" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="swap-and-repeat"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Swap and Repeat </h2> <p>The biggest benefit of git is collaboration – it makes it easier to work with other people on the same program. The next step of today’s lab is to learn how that works by swapping roles. The current driver (the person at the keyboard) will become the navigator, and the navigator will become the driver. And you should now use the navigator’s computer.</p> <p>Go through all of the same steps, starting with “<a href="#set-up-your-computer-to-use-the-new-git-repository">Set up your computer to use the new git repository</a>” on the navigator’s computer. When you edit the file, <em>add</em> your name to the file, so that it says “By: Driver Name and Navigator Name”. Be sure to add, commit, and push the changes, and then check on the GitLab to make sure that the changes appear there.</p> <p>Once you’ve done this, then there should be a single git repository in the GitLab, and both members of the pair should have a clone of that git repository on their personal computer. Either person can work on the program, and then commit and push changes back to the repository at any time. This makes collaboration easier, because both people have a copy, and both people can work on it.</p> <h3 id="git-pull"> <a href="#git-pull" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="git-pull"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Git Pull </h3> <p>Swap roles again, so that the original driver is now driving again using their own computer.</p> <p>If you look at the files on your computer, then you’ll notice that the newest change – the one that adds the navigator’s name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> – aren’t there. What is happening is that there are changes in the main GitLab repository, but they haven’t been copied down to your computer yet.</p> <p>To do that, we can use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code>. This command will take all of the changes that are in the main repository, and pull them down to your computer. Run that now:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git pull
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now open the README.md file in the text editor on your computer, and you should see the changes, including both people’s names.</p> <p>You want to run this command any time that your partner makes any changes and then commits and pushes those changes to the repository.</p> <p>Git can be used by as many people as you want; there are git repositories with millions of people using them. Always remember to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> to make sure you have all the latest changes before you start working.</p> <h1 id="programming"> <a href="#programming" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="programming"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Programming </h1> <p>Now that you’ve got the git repository, we can start working on programming in the files in that repository.</p> <p>We are going to begin with the program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bottles.py</code>, which is a simple program that prints out lyrics to a song – the song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer">99 bottles of beer</a>.</p> <p>The first thing to do is to run the program on the command line:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python bottles.py

No one likes singing about “zero” bottles. Most of the time, that last verse gets modified; for example, the Wikipedia article lists “No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.” as the last verse.</p> <p>Create a last verse that is more interesting for the song; one that doesn’t use the word or number “zero”.</p> <h3 id="exercise-3-git-commit"> <a href="#exercise-3-git-commit" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="exercise-3-git-commit"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Exercise 3: Git Commit </h3> <p>OK, now you’ve made some changes to your bottles program.

On the 2nd computer, you should then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code>. Run the program again with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python bottles.py</code> and make sure that the 2nd computer has all of the changes that you made.</p> <h3 id="exercise-5-5-bottles"> <a href="#exercise-5-5-bottles" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="exercise-5-5-bottles"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Exercise 5: 5 bottles </h3> <p>The song right now starts with only 2 bottles.

Just put your username in the box – do NOT put the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@msu.edu</code> part.</p> <p>If you did that, then try running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> again, and use the correct username.

Generally Mac handles this well – if it didn’t work, then Mac will prompt you again next time.</p> <p>However, Windows sometimes remembers this wrong username/password, and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> commands don’t work. To fix this, go down to the start bar and search for “Windows Credential Manager”. On the page that comes up, look through the list for the git/Gitlab credential. I usually just delete the entry for git/Gitlab. Then try running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> again, and it should prompt you.</p> <h2 id="troubleshooting-git-commit"> <a href="#troubleshooting-git-commit" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="troubleshooting-git-commit"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Troubleshooting git commit </h2> <p>This section contains extra instructions for troubleshooting problems with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>.
