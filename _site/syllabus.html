viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Description </h2> <p>This course is an undergraduate level first course in computer programming. The goal of this class is to help students become familiar with how we go about telling computers what to do (programming), and understanding how that process usually works. Students will learn enough that they are able to do some programming on their own, and will also have a much better understanding of how programming works, what kinds of things computers can and can’t do, and how to talk with and interact with professional programmers. All students will be able to learn how to program; this course is not just for students with pre-existing skills or aptitute. Students are not expected to continue on to additional programming courses after this; the material in this course is self-contained and useful even without further courses. This course is not appropriate for students who already have programming skills (e.g. previously took CSE 231 or another programming course).</p> <p>Programming is really just the act of trying to get the computer to do what you want it to do; that is, programming a computer is telling the computer what to do in a way that the computer can understand and accomplish. Despite being “high tech”, computers are surprisingly unsophisticated, and it is important to understand how computers think in order to get them to do what you want. That is the goal of this class – to learn how computers think just enough that you can tell them what to do in a way that works.</p> <p>Computers are one of the most useful general purpose tools we have, and a large number of jobs involve interacting with computers in interesting and complicated ways. This course is designed for students that will need to use computers, but who don’t want to be come full-time programmers. We will particularly focus on skills that are useful in media and technology jobs, such as user experience design, graphic design, game design, and interactive media production. But really, these skills can be applied to an extremely wide variety of non-programming jobs.</p> <h2 id="course-structure-and-schedule"> <a href="#course-structure-and-schedule" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-structure-and-schedule"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Structure and Schedule </h2> <p>Thiis course has a weekly structure. Each week will have a small set of topics and skills that we will be focusing on learning. The goal of this class is to spend most of the class <em>practicing</em> these skills, getting better over time. The weekly topics do build on each other, so it is important to strive to learn the skills each week so they can continue to be applied in future weeks.</p> <p>Each week is divided into three parts. First, outside of class, you will read readings and/or watch videos, to learn some vocabulary and basic concepts. Second, on Mondays, we will spend the time in class doing a “lab”: a structured exercise designed to help you build a specific set of skills. Third, on Wednesdays, the class time will be spent doing a “studio”: a loosely structured, creative activity designed to give you an opportunity to apply the skills you’ve been building to create new and interesting things.</p> <h3 id="part-1-readings--videos"> <a href="#part-1-readings--videos" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="part-1-readings--videos"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Part 1: Readings / videos </h3> <p>I will post a set of readings / videos. Most will be required; some will be optional. You will need to read and/or watch them, and then write a short summary+question about them. This is a chance to take responsibility for your learning; be sure to pause/rewind/rewatch things until you feel like you understand them. After reading or watching the videos, you will need to write up a short summary+question, which is intended to help us (the instructor and TA) understand what makes sense and what is confusing.</p> <p>Being confused is OK and normal; computers don’t think like people do, and trying to think like a computer is weird and unnatural. Everyone gets confused (I certainly did when I was learning), but everyone gets confused about different things. It is OK to be confused.</p> <p>Summary: Summarize how you think the core concept of the week works (max 1 paragraph long). Use words like “because” and be sure to include reasons and evidence.</p> <p>Question: Ask one question about the topics. Questions can be a confusion question; if you get confused, point out where you were confused (timestamp for video or section of text) and write down your question. OR, the question can be a curiosity; if you were inspired and curious about something and want to learn more, write that question down. OR, the question can be a connection; it can take one of the concepts from week and apply it to some other aspect of your life or work.</p> <h3 id="part-2-lab-mondays"> <a href="#part-2-lab-mondays" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="part-2-lab-mondays"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Part 2: Lab (Mondays) </h3> <p>Every Monday, we will do a lab exercise. Labs are structured exercises where you work through a small series of problems, trying to get things working.</p> <p>In lab, you will always be pair programming. You will be assigned into pair, and will have to work as a pair. Pair programming follows the mantra “2 people, 1 computer”. While pair programming, only one computer should be actively used for programing. The other person’s computer (and phone and tablet) shouldn’t be touched. The two people must work together to solve the problem. After completing each problem, then the two must switch roles; whoever was at the keyboard becomes the assistant, and whoever was assisting moves to the keyboard.</p> <p>Labs will be graded based on effort (did you work on the lab for the entire class?), on attendance (did you attend the whole lab?) and on teamwork (did you help others?)</p> <!-- and will be graded on a check / check plus / check minus / zero scale. --> <h3 id="part-3-studio-wednesdays"> <a href="#part-3-studio-wednesdays" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="part-3-studio-wednesdays"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Part 3: Studio (Wednesdays) </h3> <p>Every Wednesday, we will do a studio exercise. Studios are less structured exercises where you are given a realistic problem or creative goal, and you must try to figure out a way to solve it. There is no right answer to studios; instead, this is an opportunity for you to be creative and use the skills you are developing to get computers to do interesting things.</p> <p>You are required to work in teams in studio. Teams must be at least two people, and no more than 4 people can be in a team. Which team you are on is up to you. While working on the studio, you are strongly encouraged to work in pair programming; I find that you actually get more done when pair programming than when everyone works separately.</p> <p>Studios are graded solely on attendance and support; since there is no right or wrong answer to studio exercises we are not grading whether you accomplish them or not. Studios are open ended tasks; there is no place that signifies when you are “done”. Students are expected to spend the entire class period working on the studio.</p> <h2 id="assignments-and-grading"> <a href="#assignments-and-grading" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="assignments-and-grading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Assignments and Grading </h2> <p>Each week, students will receive a total of 3 grades: one grade for the summary+question from the readings, one grade for the work during the lab, and a grade for participating in the studio.</p> <p>The question+summary will be graded on a check / check plus / check minus / zero basis. If you complete the the assignment by summarizing the ideas and asking a reasonable question, you will earn a check. If your summary integrates across readings / videos or with past weeks, or if you ask a good question, or are particularly good describing a way that you are confused, then you will earn a check plus. If the summary is superficial or overly simple, and if the question doesn’t help resolve confusion, then you may receive a check minus. Finally, if the assignment isn’t turned in or if it is missing either the summary or question, then you will receive a zero for it. Question+summary assignments are due on Monday before class, and can be submitted on D2L by going to Assignments -&gt; Quizzes. Unexcused late assignments will not be accepted.</p> <p>All students who attend and participate in the entire studio will earn a check for the studio. Students who are effective at helping others or are particularly creative and engaged in the studio may receive a check plus for the studio; all students should be able to earn a check plus for studio if they try. Students who leave early or who work on other work during studio will receive a check minus for the studio. Students who do not attend studio or do not participate at all will receive a zero.</p> <p>A check earns nine out of possible 10 points. A check plus earns the full 10 points. A check minus earns 7 points.</p> <p>Labs will also be graded using a check / check plus / check minus. Students must attend labs on time to be eligible for a check or a check plus. In order to leave the lab early, you must complete all of the exercises, and also at least one or two of the optional challenges in the lab (and also check with the professor). Please turn in screenshots of your working lab (via D2L) and check your code into GitLab and share the project with the professor and TA (after week 2) to receive full credit.</p> <p>You will not be permitted to get credit for making up missed work. As a class, we will be working together, learning from each other and helping each other figure out how to program; as such, making up work outside of class misses this benefit. However, each week of the class builds on prior weeks, so if you miss some of the work, you may find it valuable to do it on your own time. If you know ahead-of-time that you will miss class, please contact the instructor.</p> <p>You will be allowed to drop the lowest four scores for labs or studios during the semester, and also drop two summary+question scores. This effectively allows you miss the equivalent of two weeks of class without penalty. You don’t need permission or to explain why you are dropping the assignment; it is OK if things come up in your life (busy week, stressful week, sick, etc.) and you need to drop an assignment to help you through it. If you have circumstances that require you to miss or underperform for more than these dropped assignments, then talk to the instructor (preferably ahead of time) and we can try to work out something. Excused absences will only apply after dropping these lowest scores.</p> <p>60% of the final grade be based on the labs/studios. 20% will be based on the summary+questions. And the final 20% is the final project.</p> <h3 id="final-project"> <a href="#final-project" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="final-project"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Final Project </h3> <p>During the last week of the semester, we will be doing a week-long studio. This studio will be an interesting exercise where you will work in a group and use all of the skills you built during the semester to make a creative, interactive computer program. The work that occurs during this last week will be graded as normal for studios (attendance-based, check/check plus/check minus).</p> <p>The program you write during this final studio will also be turned in and graded as a final project for the course. We will evaluate how well you were able to use ideas and skills from the course to create something new and interesting. This final project will be turned in via GitLab (you will learn how to do this in class), and will be due at the normally scheduled finals period. You are welcome to turn in what you have at the end of the last class, or to continue working on it after classes are over; its up to you. The grade for this final project will be 20% of your final grade.</p> <p>The final project will be due during the scheduled final exam period: Wednesday, May 3rd at 7:45pm. However, normally, most of the work on this project will be done during class during the final week of the semester.</p> <p>There are <strong>no exams</strong> in ths course.</p> <h2 id="readings"> <a href="#readings" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="readings"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Readings </h2> <p>This class does not have a textbook. However, required readings and videos will be posted to the <a href="/schedule.html">schedule</a> on this website.</p> <p>You should do the readings <em>before the class</em> meeting under which those readings are listed in the schedule of readings – that is the day on which the material will be used in class.</p> <h2 id="attendance"> <a href="#attendance" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="attendance"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Attendance </h2> <p>In this class, we work together to learn more about programming. Almost all of the time in class is spent working in pairs or teams trying to learn how to get the computer to do what we want it to do. Because we learn in teams, it is important to attend all classes; you can’t learn from your teammates if you aren’t present, and they can’t learn from you. Also, it is similarly important to arrive on time, spend the class time working with your team, and remain for the full class period. Your teammates will appreciate your help, and you will learn best if you spend the time practicing.</p> <p>If you find yourself having difficulty spending the entire class period working on programming, please talk to the instructor about it. This could be because you find the tasks boring, because you don’t get along with teammates, or because other things in your life are intruding on class; regardless, talk to the instructor and he will work with you to find a productive way forward.</p> <p>If you arrive late, leave early, or spend a non-trivial amount of time during class on non-class activities, your grade for that class period may be reduced. If there is a reason that you will regularly need to arrive late or leave early, please come and talk to the instructor about it; since most of the work in class is done in pairs or teams, this will make it difficult for your teammates, and I want to be fair to everyone.</p> <h3 id="absences"> <a href="#absences" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="absences"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Absences </h3> <p>Emergencies and other unexpected issues do unfortunately happen. In addition, students may be facing additional challenges due to the pandemic. The “drop four” structure for in-class activities is designed to offer flexibility to accommodate unexpected absences. In the event of an unexpected absence, students are responsible for obtaining information about what they missed from others taking the course.</p> <p>If you wish to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday, please make arrangements in advance. If you must miss a class to participate in an officially-sanctioned athletic game or in a required activity for another course, you must provide adequate advanced notice beforehand, such as a team schedule or written authorization from the faculty member of the other course or a university administrator. If something else comes up and you need special considerations, please contact Dr. Wash to discuss alternative options.</p> <h2 id="technology"> <a href="#technology" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="technology"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Technology </h2> <p>You are required to bring a computer to class, and will be required to install appropriate programming tools on the computer. You are required to use your own technology to complete assignments. If you do not have an appropriate laptop computer or if your computer is not able to run the needed software, please talk to the instructor about it. We will be learning how to use <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a>, though you will install and learn them during class.</p> <p>You will be working in pairs and teams, and in particular in lab you will be doing pair programming, which involves two people using one computer. You do NOT have to allow other people to use your computer; it is perfectly OK to ask your partner to use their computer when they are driving. However, you still must do pair programming, which involves one person driving, or controlling the computer, while the other person looks at the screen from beside them and provides input and help. This means that other people will be looking at your screen; I suggest closing or minimizing other windows and/or temporarily disabling notifications to protect your privacy while you work.</p> <p>In general, I expect that all technology will be primarily used for class purposes. However, not everyone will be able to achieve that goal. It is OK to occasionally use your computers for non-class purposes. However, if that technology becomes distracting to others I reserve the right to ask you to stop what you are doing or ask you to leave class while you complete what you are doing.</p> <h3 id="spring-2023-contingency-plans"> <a href="#spring-2023-contingency-plans" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="spring-2023-contingency-plans"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Spring 2023 Contingency Plans </h3> <p>COVID-19 is again creating uncertainty this semester that could impact the course schedule and deadlines. For example, class sessions may be cancelled due to instructor illness, or the university may go online again. We will be flexible as the need arises. The schedule and syllabus may need to change. All announcements will be posted to D2L; please watch for such announcements.</p> <p>MI 250 will always be <em>synchronous</em>: we will all meet at the same time every week. However, for as long as we need to meet online, we will be meeting virtually using Zoom to communicate. On these days, please plan on being somewhere with a reasonable Internet connection for the entire time period of the class, and make it somewhere where you can hear your teammates talk and can talk yourself on zoom. Also, please devote your attention to class during that time.</p> <p>Online participation will only be allowed when the entire university moves online; when we are meeting in person, it is not possible to complete the work online. I have found that hybrid class, with most people in person and a small number online, does not work and the online students do not learn the same.</p> <!-- ### Attending the class online When we are online, the most important thing is to find a place where you are comfortable and can sit and work for 2 hours. You will be actively working on problems and programming, and will be actively talking to and collaborating with classmates. Be sure you are somewhere where you can hear audio from your classmates, and where you can talk to them. So make sure that you have: * Reliable broadband internet connection * Your working computer. We will install the class tools installed on it (git, python, editor) * Are able to listen to audio from your computer * Are in a place where it is OK to talk to your computer * Have Zoom and Slack installed on your computer, and you are signed up for the Slack workspace for the class, and have Zoom version 5.4 or later #### What class will be like online This is a very hands-on course. Students will be practicing the programming methods discussed in the course through taking part in team-based activities during class time. There will be little, if any lecturing. Students are expected to engage in active participation in the in-class activities. Active participation means paying attention to the instructions, actively working with teammates, taking appropriate notes during the exercise, speaking up with ideas and thoughts, and treating other people and ideas with respect. Pair programming is a very important part of the class. It helps you learn more programming, and learn faster, and it reduces the frustration that is inherent in learning programming. Pairs and teams will work remotely. The main way we will do this is with Zoom. Initially, when class first starts, everyone will be in one big video conference. I will then create "breakout rooms" where you and your partner can go to work together on the labs. You will receive an "invitation" to enter a breakout room through Zoom. The breakout rooms will just include you and your partner/teammates. One person can share their screen using Zoom’s screen sharing feature, and that person will be the "driver". The other person can continue being the "navigator", watching the coding, talking with the driver about issues, thinking about the exercises, and generally helping out. You can talk with each other normally and work together on programming. It is a good idea to periodically switch who is driving, which can easily be done by stoping screen sharing and having the new driver start screen sharing. For each class students will join the main Zoom, and at some point during each class session be assigned to a "breakout" Zoom room for a team-based in-class activity. If possible, students should turn on video to interact with their peers in breakouts; video is optional when the entire class meets together in the main Zoom. More information about Zoom screen sharing:<https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen> and<https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/201740106-Screen-Sharing> --> <!-- In addition to Zoom, we will use slack at a chat backchannel. There is a channel — [#classroom](https://mi-250.slack.com/archives/CVCFPP8P8) -- where you can chat with everyone in class. Feel free to post questions here and chat with others in class. --> <!-- At any time, if you have a question, you can message Caitlin and I on Zoom or use the "Ask for Help" button in Zoom. Then one of us will join your breakout room where we can talk with you and see your screen. Additionally, we may pop in to your breakout rooms occasionally to see how you are doing, answer any minor questions you have, and provide coaching as you work. --> <h3 id="course-communication"> <a href="#course-communication" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-communication"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Communication </h3> <p>All messages and announcements will be posted on D2L; some announcements will also be sent via email to the MSU email accounts of students registered in the class. You are expected to be familiar with all information posted on D2L, so please check D2L frequently and ensure that notifications are turned on so you are made aware of any posted announcements. You are also responsible for being aware of announcements made in class.</p> <h2 id="policies-and-procedures"> <a href="#policies-and-procedures" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="policies-and-procedures"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Policies and Procedures </h2> <p><em>Announcements</em>: I will occasionally post announcements about this course. Announcements will be posted both to this website and to D2L. Everyone is expected to pay attention and be familiar with these announcements.</p> <p><em>Assignments</em>: Assignments will be submitted online, either via D2L or via GitLab. Late assignments will not be accepted. Of course, if negotiated in advance, reasonable exceptions may be granted by the professor.</p> <p><em>Academic Honesty</em>: Michigan State University and the Department of Media and Information both have policies about academic dishonesty. Basically, make sure that everything you turn in with your name on it is your own work, and don’t cheat or lie. If it feels like cheating, it probably is; if you are unsure please ask. Students caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a 0 for the assignment and be reported to the university. Working together with other students in this class and other classes, however, is encouraged. Make sure that everything you turn in with your name on it is original work of yours.</p> <p>For classes that involve complex thinking and no right answers like this, I strongly encourage you to work together and ask each other for help. Indeed, this course requires you to work with others. Often when you have a problem or a confusion, the best place to go for help is your colleagues who are also working on similar issues. Also, the Internet is a fantastic source of information when you are stuck. Use these resources copiously. However, make sure that you personally write and understand all of the work that you turn in. Directly copying text that you don’t understand from the Internet or from others is academically dishonest.</p> <p><em>Accommodations for Disabilities</em>: Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at <a href="http://rcpd.msu.edu">http://rcpd.msu.edu</a>. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation (“VISA”) form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (test, project, etc). Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible.</p> <p><em>Absences</em>: If you are not feeling well, please consider the health of your classmates and instructors and <em>do not come to class</em>. In general, students should follow <a href="https://msu.edu/together-we-will/_assets/images/covid-what-to-do-may-22-students-v2.pdf">MSU’s COVID guidance</a> if you are not feeling well or test positive for COVID.</p> <p>In addition, students who are ill or isolating and must miss class should let Dr. Wash know as soon as possible. The course’s policy that “drops the lowest scores” is designed to offer flexibility to accommodate unexpected absences and difficulty in completing assignments equivalent to missing two weeks of class. If a student’s illness persists for longer than two weeks, they should contact Dr. Wash ASAP to discuss potential accommodations and what kind of documentation may be necessary. With approved extenuating circumstances, it is possible to do part of the class work from home for partial credit.</p> <p><em>Grief Absences</em>: If a student has experienced the death of a family member or someone close to them, or is experiencing emotional distress from a similar tragedy, they may request a grief absence. To request a grief absence, visit the Grief Absence Request Form found on the RO home page ( <a href="https://reg.msu.edu/">https://reg.msu.edu/</a> ) under “Student Resources – Forms – Grief Absence Request Form” OR on StuInfo ( <a href="https://stuinfo.msu.edu/">https://stuinfo.msu.edu/</a> ) under “Academics – Enrollment Information and Services – Grief Absence Request Form”. See the grief absence policy for more information: <a href="https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/griefabsence.aspx">https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/griefabsence.aspx</a>. Once your grief absence is approved, we will exempt you from the in-class activities for the approved dates. This means those classes won’t count towards your grade at all, and also won’t count as part of your 4 “dropped grades”.</p> <p><em>Religious Holidays</em>: You may make up course work missed to observe a major religious holiday only if you make arrangements in advance with the instructor. Absences due to religious holidays, when communicated in advance, will not count as one of the dropped scores.</p> <p><em>Required Activity</em>: To make up course work missed to participate in a university-sanctioned event, you must provide the instructor with adequate advance notice and written authorization from a university administrator.</p> <p><em>Technical Assistance</em>: Asking your peers in class and your instructor is a great source for technical assistance. This is particularly true with the technologies we are learning in class (python, git, etc.). For MSU-provided technologies, you can visit the <a href="http://help.msu.edu">MSU Help site</a>, the <a href="http://help.d2l.msu.edu">Desire2Learn Help Site</a> or email the <a href="mailto:ithelp@msu.edu">MSU IT Service Desk</a>.</p> <p><em>Tolerance and Civility</em>: MSU strives to build an academic community with living and learning environments that expects tolerance of viewpoints and civility toward others, whether at public forums, athletic events, in residential communities, classrooms or laboratories. We call upon all who participate in university events to promote tolerance and civil behavior and to hold themselves to high standards that reflect the university’s commitment to respect viewpoints that may be different from their own. Only by respecting individuals with diverse perspectives and ideas can we build an environment of civility that is conducive to advancing knowledge and transforming lives.</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
