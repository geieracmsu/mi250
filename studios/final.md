We will be continuing to work on our [Choose Your Own Adventure engine and story]({% link labs/final.md %}). Please keep working on it today with the **same group** you had on Tuesday.

As you work, think about the code you wrote on Tuesday. Does it still make sense? Is there anything you wish you had done differently so it would be easier to work with today?

Also, think about *scope*: how much can you get done? You worked for about 2 hours on Tuesday, and you've got another 2 hours or so to work today. How much did you get done on Tuesday? What do you still have left to do? Do you think you'll reasonably be able to complete that work by the end of class today? If you don't have much left, you might want to expand your scope and add some addtional features or story elements. If you have too much left, you'll need to prioritize and maybe cut some of the features or story elements you were planning.

Remember if you don't complete the project in class, you will still have time to complete it next week. **The project is due at the end of the finals period for this class: 12pm on Thursday, December 14th.**

## Grading and rubric

This was also in the instructions for Tuesday, but here it is again.

In addition to the normal check, check plus, check minus grades for participating in class this week, this project will receive a grade
as the final project for the class. This grade is based on how well the program works and how interesting / creative the program is. This class has not only taught you how to program, but also emphasized how programming is a useful tool for expressing creativity.

The grade for your final project is 20% of your overall grade for the class. Each student in the group will receive the same grade for the project. Here is a rubric will we use to determine your grade for the project:

*Basic necessities* (aka the “Minimum Viable Product”) (70% of grade; 10% each)
* Program runs (with minimal effort)
* Content exists; the program tells a story
* Program is interactive and gives the user multiple paths to follow (those choices matter for the story)
* Logic of program separated from content somehow
* Option to quit the program exists
* Code is stored in Gitlab
* Screenshots of final, working program in D2L (or in Gitlab)

The remaining 30% of the grade is for going beyond the minimum and making an interesting choose-your-own-adventure program. This can be done through creativity, through programming, or through a combination of both:

*Creativity*
* Tells an interesting story
* Story has an interesting setting / millieu
* Turtle interface that looks  interesting 
* Turtle interface that adds to the story
* Other, unanticipated creative strengths

*Programming*
* The program is well commented and easy to read
* The code and content is well organized
* Uses interesting programming / logic to tell the story
* Uses complex-but-not-unnecessarily-complex code/logic (e.g. dictionaries / files)
* Other, unanticipated programming strengths

Each of these can be awarded 0-15 percentage points based on how good / interesting it is. Maximum grade is 100%. Generally, if one of these things is there, it is worth 5%. If it is good, then 10%, and if it is really great, then 15%. Plan to incorprate at least 2 things which go beyond the minimum, and play to your group’s strengths.

You will turn your project in the same way as you have been all semester - put the code in Gitlab, and turn in screenshots on D2L. Make sure to add both Jack and Caitlin as *maintainers* on your GitLab repo, or else we won't be able to grade your project!

## Collaboration outside of class

You do not have to work outside of class. In past years, many groups have finished their final project during the normal class periods.  However, if you would like to continue to work on this project outside of class, you are welcome to do so; you will still have a full week left to work on it after today. I encourage you to continue to use git and GitLab for your collaboration; you've been using it all semester, and it is specifically designed for collaboration on programming projects like this. It might be useful to create a WhatsApp group or a group text or exchange email addresses so you can keep in touch with your group.

You don't have to work synchronously with your team, but it is often nice to so do. If it's too hard to meet in person, you can create your own Zoom meetings for your team by going to [https://msu.zoom.us](https://msu.zoom.us), logging in, and scheduling a new meeting.
