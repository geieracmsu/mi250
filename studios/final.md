We will be continuing to work on our [Choose Your Own Adventure engine and story]({% link labs/final.md %}).  Please
keep working on it today with the same group you had on Monday.

As you work, think about the code you wrote on Monday.  Does it still make sense?  Is there anything you wish you had
done differently so it would be easier to work with today?

Also, think about *scope*: how much can you get done?  You worked for about 2 hours on Monday, and you've got another 2
hours or so to work today.  How much did you get done on Monday?  What do you still have left to do?  Do you think
you'll reasonably be able to complete that work by the end of class today? If you don't have much left, you might want
to expand your scope and add some addtional features or story elements.  If you have too much left, you'll need to
prioritize and maybe cut some of the features or story elements you were planning.

## Final Project

This Choose-Your-Own-Adventure engine and story is the final project for the course.  You should be able to get it
working during the approximately 4 hours of class time this week. Once you feel like your adventure program is finished,
please make sure that the current, working version is checked into a git repository stored on MSU's GitLab, and that GitLab
project is shared with both the instructor and the TA.  Also, please submit screenshots of your program working on D2L.

*Due*: Wednesday, May 3rd at 7:45pm (the scheduled final exam period)

### Grading 

In addition to the normal check, check plus, check minus grades for class this week, this project will receive a grade
as the final project for the class.   This grade is based on how well the program works and how interesting / creative
the program is. This class has not only taught you how to program, but also emphasized how programming is a useful tool
for expressing creativity.

The grade for your final project is 20% of your overall grade for the class.
Here is how the grade for your final project will be determined:

*Basic necessities* (aka the “Minimum Viable Product”) (70% of grade; 10% each)
* Program runs (with minimal effort)
* Content exists; the program tells a story
* Program is interactive and gives the user multiple paths to follow (those choices matter for the story)
* Logic of program separated from content somehow
* Option to quit the program exists
* Code is stored in Gitlab
* Screenshots of final, working program in D2L (or in Gitlab)

The remaining 30% of the grade is for going beyond the minimum, and making an interesting choose-your-own-adventure
program. This can be done through creativity, through programming, or through a combination of both:

*Creativity*
* Tells an interesting story
* Story has an interesting setting / millieu
* Turtle interface that looks  interesting 
* Turtle interface that adds to the story
* Other, unanticipated creative strengths

*Programming*
* The program is well commented and easy to read
* The code and content is well organized
* Uses interesting programming / logic to tell the story
* Uses complex-but-not-unnecessarily-complex code/logic (e.g. dictionaries / files)
* Other, unanticipated programming strengths

Each of these can be awarded 0-15 percentage points based on how good / interesting it is. Maximum grade is 100%.
Generally, if one of these things is there, it is worth 5%. If it is good, then 10%, and if it is really great, then
15%. Plan to incorprate at least 2 things which go beyond the minimum, and play to your group’s strengths.

### Collaboration Outside of Class

You do not have to work outside of class.  In past years, many groups have finished their final project during the
normal class periods.  However, if you would like to continue to work on this project outside of class, you are welcome
to do so.  The final project isn't due until the scheduled final exam time.  You are welcome to use any collaboration
tools that you like.  I encourage you to continue to use git and GitLab for your collaboration; you've been using it all
semester, and it is specifically designed for collaboration on programming projects like this.

You don't have to work synchronously with your team, but it is often nice to so do.  You can create your own zoom
meetings for your team by going to [https://msu.zoom.us](https://msu.zoom.us), logging in, and scheduling a new meeting.
<!-- Also, the common area outside of the Holden Hall classroom is also a good place to meet for group work, and might make 
work faster / easier than meeting virtually. -->
