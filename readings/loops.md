topic: Loops and Variables
parent: Week 3
---

The readings for this week cover three topics.  First, we will learn a bit about loops -- while loops and for loops.
Second, there is a reading about using strings (text) and working more with them.  And third, there is a little bit
about generating random numbers in python.

### Loops
* [Think Python, Chapter 7](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2008.html): Iteration
* [Automate the Boring Stuff, Chapter 2](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/) -- Starting with "While Loops"
  and going to the end

### Strings

* [Automate the Boring Stuff, Chapter 6](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter6/): Strings.   (Don't need to read
  "Project: Password Locker")
* [The print() function in Python](https://realpython.com/python-print/) -- Stop reading at "Printing Custom Data Types"

### Numbers in Python
* [Integers and Floats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khKv-8q7YmY) -- (video)
* [Numbers in Python 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJKEqaaSGDs) -- (video)

## Summary + Question

Read the readings and watch the videos. Doing this will help you begin to understand the three concepts we will be
working with this week. Once youâ€™ve finished the readings, write up a short summary of the readings.  What is the most
interesting part of loops, of strings, and of numbers?

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
