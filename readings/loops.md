## Readings

The readings for this week cover three topics.  First, we will learn a bit more about strings and about the print() function, which outputs strings. We've been using both in class already. Second, we'll learn about two kinds of loops -- while loops and for loops. And third, we'll learn a bit about using random numbers in Python.

### Strings and Print()

* [Automate the Boring Stuff, Chapter 6: Manipulating Strings](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter6/){:target="_blank"} -- Stop reading at "Project: Password Locker"
* [The print() function in Python](https://realpython.com/python-print/){:target="_blank"} -- Stop reading at "Printing Custom Data Types"

### Loops
* [Loops in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-python/){:target="_blank"}
* [Learn Python: Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops){:target="_blank"} - practice. Note the exercise at the end uses lists, which we won't cover in class for a couple weeks.

### Randomness

* [Random Numbers in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-numbers-in-python/#){:target="_blank"}

## Summary

For the summary this week, focus on loops and randomness. Think about similar things you have encountered before.

**Summary prompt:** How would you describe loops and randomness in your own words, and what do you think each thing might be used for in programs?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on Monday.
