topic: Revisiting Functions
parent: Week 10

Please read the following about functions:

* [Think Python: Functions](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2004.html)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) -- Stop reading at "Local and Global Scope"

Yes, you read these before.   Now that you've worked with functions, read them again.  Functions are one of the most
important concepts in programming.  This time, specifically focus on the ideas of "parameters" and "return values".  You
will learn new things when you read them again.

Also read:

* [Think Python, Chapter 6](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2007.html): Fruitful Functions (Just read section 6.1)

This week's readings are about functions.  We've used functions in the past as ways of simplying naming sections of
code.  But they are more interesting that than.  They can accept parameters that modify what they do, and they can
return values.  As you read about these features of functions, try to understand how you might use them.  Summarize 1)
what is a parameter to a function and when might you want to use one; and 2) what is a return value from a function and
when might you want to use it? 

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
