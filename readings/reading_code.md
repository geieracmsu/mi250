Please read these readings:

* [Automate the Boring Stuff, Chapter 15](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter15/) -- Time (stop at Multithreading)
* <https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/06/01/how-to-read-code/>
* <https://selftaughtcoders.com/how-to-quickly-and-effectively-read-other-peoples-code/>

Also, please skim through the following:

* [Automate the Boring Stuff, Chapter 2](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/) -- Starting with "While Loops"
  and going to the end
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/): Functions
* [Think Python: Chapter 10](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2011.html): Lists
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 5](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/) -- Dictionaries and Structuring Data

Yes, you read those before.  Skim through them again.   Now that you've spent some time working with these ideas (for
loops, lists, dictionaries, functions), they should make sense in a different way. When you read through these again,
you'll see the ideas in a completely new and different way.  

As you re-read these, what new things do you notice that you didn't last time?  Is there anything that makes more sense
this time through than last time?  Summarize what new things you learned by re-reading these readings again and thinking
about them after having written code using these concepts.  Submit this summary on D2L.

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
