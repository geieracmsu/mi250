This week's topic is reading code. You've been doing a lot of this already, but it's important to keep practicing. One of the most important skills you can have as a programmer is to be able to read and understand code that other people have written.

## Readings

* [The Most Important Skill for a Developer Is Reading Code](https://medium.com/teawithtechies/the-most-important-skill-for-developers-is-reading-code-f5fcc5759f72){:target="_blank"} 
* [How to Quickly and Effectively Read Other People's Code](https://selftaughtcoders.com/how-to-quickly-and-effectively-read-other-peoples-code/){:target="_blank"}

Also, please skim through the following:

* [Loops in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-python/){:target="_blank"}
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 3 - Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/){:target="_blank"}
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 4 - Lists](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/){:target="_blank"}
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 5 - Dictionaries and Structuring Data](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/){:target="_blank"}

Yes, you read those before. Skim through them again. Now that you've spent some time working with these ideas (for loops, lists, dictionaries, functions), they should make sense in a different way.  

## Summary

As you re-read these, what new things do you notice that you didn't last time? Is there anything that makes more sense this time through than last time? Also think about the times you've read code written by other people - for example, code you've found through Google or code your partner(s) have written in studios.

**Summary prompt:** How has being able to read other people's code helped you out this semester? What's hard about reading code other people have written?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on Monday.
