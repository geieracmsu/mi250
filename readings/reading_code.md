This week's topic is reading code. You've been doing a lot of this already, but it's important to keep practicing. One of the most important skill you can have as a programmer is to be able to read and understand code that other people have written.

## Readings

* [The Most Important Skill for a Developer Is Reading Code](https://medium.com/teawithtechies/the-most-important-skill-for-developers-is-reading-code-f5fcc5759f72){:target="_blank"} 
* [How to Quickly and Effectively Read Other People's Code](https://selftaughtcoders.com/how-to-quickly-and-effectively-read-other-peoples-code/){:target="_blank"}

Also, please skim through the following:

* [Loops in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-python/){:target="_blank"}
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 3 - Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/){:target="_blank"}
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 4 - Lists](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/){:target="_blank"}
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 5 - Dictionaries and Structuring Data](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/){:target="_blank"}

Yes, you read those before. Skim through them again. Now that you've spent some time working with these ideas (for loops, lists, dictionaries, functions), they should make sense in a different way.  

## Summary

As you re-read these, what new things do you notice that you didn't last time?  Is there anything that makes more sense
this time through than last time?

**Summary prompt:** What new things did you learn by re-reading these readings again?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

We do not have class on Tuesday this week. Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on THursday. Thursday's class will be a lab.
