There are no readings for this week.  However, I would like you to think about and
submit a summary+question.

For this week's summary, think back over the class.  What have you learned? Do you feel like you are able to program
computers now?  Do you feel like you understand programming enough that you could work with a professional, where you do
related work (technology design, art design, game design, advertising design, etc.) and tell the programmers what to do?
What skills do you think you understand pretty well?  What skills do you feel like you still need to learn?  

There is a lot more about programming that you can learn; this was just one course.  But reflect over this course and
summarize what kinds of things you feel like you are now able to do that you couldn't do at the beginning of the course.
For the summary part of the assignment, summarize what you feel like you've learned in this course.

For the question part of the course, think about how you might use these skills in the future. How do you think you
might use the skills you learned in your future courses?  in your future career?  in your future life?  Are you already
using the skills from this course in interesting and valuable ways?
