You don't have to read everything in it, just look around to get a basic idea of what's in it.

There are tons and tons of content-based APIs out there. To get an idea of the kinds of information that can be available in APIs, take a look at [this huge list of public APIs available on Github](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis){:target="_blank"}, and [an even bigger list of both free and paid APIs on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub){:target="_blank"}.

## Summary

For this week's summary, browse through the available APIs (links above). Think about what you might want to use some of these APIs for.

**Summary prompt:** Summarize your thoughts on APIs and what they are (and aren't) useful for.

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
