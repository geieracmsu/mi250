Please read the following short articles:

* [Absolute Beginners Guide to Slaying APIs using Python](https://medium.com/quick-code/absolute-beginners-guide-to-slaying-apis-using-python-7b380dc82236)
* [Python API Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/)
* [Intermediate Python API Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/last-fm-api-python/)

For more information about possible APIs, you can look at a [long list here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

All of these are tutorials that explain what an API is and how to use a couple of common ones.  As you read these, think
about the kinds of things you might use APIs for. What might you want to use an API for?  What APIs do you want to
exist?  Browse through the [long list of APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and think about what other
APIs you might want to use.  Summarize your thoughts on APIs, and what they are useful for, and what they are not useful
for, on D2L.

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
