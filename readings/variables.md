When learning how to play a musical instrument, a lot of your time needs to be spent *practicing*: actually playing that
instrument.   Learning to program is very similar; most of the time learning to program should be spent actually
programming.

Each week in this class, I will assign some readings and/or videos for you to read (watch).  This is the only homework
for this class, but it is very important that you do it.  We will not spend time in class discussing these readings;
instead we will assume that you know them and will spend the time in class practicing what you are learning.

This week, we get started with our first steps toward programming.  It helps to try to understand some important
concepts that we will then use during programming. You can program without these concepts, but the programs will be
easier and make more sense if you've heard of these concepts and have a basic understanding of them.  

That's why we have some readings each week.  These readings will help you understand better what you are trying to do as
you program.  You can program without them, but it is much much harder.  Spending a little bit of time reading and
trying to understand what you are reading will make it much easier to actually do programming during class.

## Making Programs Do Stuff

This week, the readings cover initially how to get python to do some things, including using it as a calculator and
getting it to output things.   To understand the concepts, read these online book chapters:

* [Think Python: The Way of the Program](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html)
* [Think Python: Variables, Expressions, and Statements](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Python Basics](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Flow Control](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/) -- only the first half, up to
but not including "For loops and the range() function"

Yes, I know that there is overlap in these chapters; they sometimes talk about the same things.  Please read all of
them.  This won't take long, and having heard the concepts in different places and in different ways will help them make
more sense to you.

## Summary + Question

Don't spent a lot of time going back through these readings.  It is important to read them, but don't read them multiple
times right now. If there are things in them that don't quite make sense yet, that's OK; you'll get a chance to actually
do some programming in class where you use many of these concepts, and that will hopefully help those concepts make more
sense.

After reading and/or watching the week's assignment, you need to write up what I am calling a "Summary + Question".
This has two parts (obviously :):

#### Summary
Sometimes, you will be asked to do an "open summary", where you summarize what you understand about the concept of the
week.   Other times, you will be asked to do a "guided summary" where I specifically give you a question or two and ask
you to answer them.  Either way, the summary should be more than one sentence long, but no longer than one-two
paragraphs.  Either way, this is your opportunity to really think about the topic for the week and try to wrap your
brain around it.  Don't quote from the readings; instead try to integrate across them and use your own words to explain
the concept.

For this week, we will do a guided summary.  I want you to summarize your thinking about these readings by trying to
explain what a variable is.  How would you explain what a variable is, why they are important / useful,  and how they are
used?

#### Question

Second, I would like you to think carefully and ask a thoughful question about the readings.  That's right -- YOU ask
the question.  The instructor and the TA will read through these questions before class, and use them to help tailor the
class to the things that you are interested in and to help make sure that you are able to learn the things that you
found confusing.

There are three types of questions that you can ask (though you only have to ask one question):
* A *confusion* question asks about something that you are still confused about even after reading and watching the
assigned material. It can be confusion about a specific point or a more general confusion about the topic overall.
Confusion is OK an normal when learning a new skill.
* A *curiousity* question asks about something that makes you want to learn more about. The readings and/or videos may
have gotten you to think about something else that is related, but not really discussed in the material that you don't
understand; that is, it got you to be curious about something else.  This is a great chance to express that curiousity.  
* A *connection* isn't a question; instead, it is an example that applies the concept that your are learning to some
other aspect of your life or some other interesting thing in the world. 

After reading the material, come up with one question; it can be of any of these three types.

The question+summary can be submitted on D2L.
