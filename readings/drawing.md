## Summary + Question

Read the readings and watch the videos. Doing this will help you begin to understand the concepts we will be working
with this week. As you do the readings, I want you to specifically focus on thinking about programming computers to draw
on the screen.  Using turtle drawings is much like using a pen on paper.  Summarize your thoughts about the strengths
and weaknesses of drawing on screens using turtle graphics.

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
