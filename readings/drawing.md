This week we'll start using Python to draw images on the screen. We will be using a library called Turtle. There are a ton of commands you can use with Turtle - don't worry about memorizing them all. 

## Readings

Read the first article in full; it's short, and will give you a basic idea of what we'll be doing in the lab. The other two readings go much more in depth. Skim them and read parts that are interesting to you, but don't spend too much time on them -- skim with the goal of getting more familiar with the different things Turtle can do.

* [The Python Turtle Library, Step by Step](https://www.nickmccullum.com/python-turtle/){:target="_blank"}
* (Skim) [Ch 13: Turtle Graphics](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/chap13.pdf){:target="_blank"} -- Stop reading at 13.5 Visualizing recursion; don't read that section or anything after it
* (Skim) [Turtle Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html){:target="_blank"} -- Everything the turtle can do, in
  way too much detail (this is a great resource!)

## Summary

For the summary this week, think about all of the different things you've learned about what Turtle can do. 

**Summary prompt:** Why do you think we're learning Turtle for this class? What would you like to be able to do with programmatic drawings?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before the first class of the week.
