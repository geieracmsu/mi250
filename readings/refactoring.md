This week we're practicing refactoring - the process of improving and simplifying code you've already written.

## Readings

* [Refactoring: Introduction and Its Techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/refactoring-introduction-and-its-techniques/){:target="_blank"}
* [Working with Modules in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/modules-in-python){:target="_blank"}
* [Python File Operation](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation){:target="_blank"}

You may recognize the last two readings, from last week and from a few weeks ago. Read them again - do they make a bit more sense now?

## Summary

For the summary this week, think about the code you've written for studios throughout the semester. You know more about Python now than you did in September - how might you approach doing some of those earlier studios now? It might help to look at the [schedule]{(% link schedule.md %)} and your old Gitlab repos to refresh you memory and what the studios were and how you approached them then.

**Summary prompt:** How do you think modules and files might be useful for refactoring?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on Tuesday. NOTE: Tuesday's class will be a studio, and will be extra credit (attendance is optional). The summary+question for this week is still required.
