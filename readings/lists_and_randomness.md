parent: Week 6

Please read the following:

### Lists

* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 4](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/): Lists
* [Think Python: Chapter 10](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2011.html): Lists

Also, please read about using randomness:

### Randomness
* [How to Generate Random Numbers in
  Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-python/) -- Don't read section 3 Random
Numbers in NumPy
* [The Random Module](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/random-module)

Read the readings. Doing this will help you begin to understand the concepts we will be working
with this week. As you do the readings, I want you to specifically focus on what you might want to use lists for.  What
kinds of things have we already done in programming that you think would be easier if you had a list?  Summarize your
thoughts about lists, and specifically focus on ways they would make what we've already done easier (or harder?).

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
