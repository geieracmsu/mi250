parent: Week 3
---

The readings / videos for the this week cover a type of technology called "version control" that allows programmers to
keep track of their programs and collaborate with other programmers.  We will be using a specific type of version
control called "Git" in this class to share programs between pairs.

## Summary + Question

Read the readings and watch the videos.  Doing this will help you begin to understand the concepts we will be working
with this week.   As you do the readings, I want you to specifically focus on thinking about version control: what it is
and why do we need it?  Once you've finished the readings, write up a short summary: why do we need version
control, and how is it different than how I've shared work with group members in the past?

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
