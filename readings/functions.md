topic: Functions
parent: Week 7
---

Functions are a nice way to organize your code and make it reusable. We've already been using functions a lot in this class: `print()` is a function that's built into Python, and `forward()` and `right()` are functions that are built into the Turtle library. This week you'll start writing your own functions.

## Readings

* [Think Python: Functions](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2004.html)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) -- stop reading at "Local and Global Scope"

## Summary

For the summary this week, think about what you've learned about functions, and whether anything else you've encountered outside of the class is similar

**Summary prompt:** How would you describe what a function does, and what it's for? How is a function different from a variable?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on Tuesday.
