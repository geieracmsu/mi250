topic: Functions
parent: Week 7
---

Please read the following chapters:

* [Think Python: Functions](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2004.html)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) -- Stop reading at "Local and Global Scope"

Read the readings. Doing this will help you begin to understand the concept of "functions" that we will be working with
this week. As you do the readings, I want you to specifically think about how you might have used functions in some of
the program you write previously in this class. How would functions have helped you with your previous programming
projects? What kinds of things have we already done in programming that you think would be easier if you use a function?
Summarize your thoughts about functions, and specifically focus on ways they would make what weâ€™ve already done easier
(or harder?).

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.

The summary + question for this week can be submitted on D2L.
