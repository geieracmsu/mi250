Please re-read the following chapters about dictionaries:

* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 5](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/) -- Dictionaries and Structuring Data
* [Think Python: Chapter 11](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2012.html) -- Dictionaries (stop at
  "11.6 Memos")

Doing this will help you understand "dictionaries".  You saw these before, but the way they use dictionaries is slightly
different than the way we used them in class.  How are they different?  Are dictionaries more or less useful than you
thought?  What kinds of things that you would do in programming would you use dictionaries for?  Write a summary of what
you think dictionaries are good for?   What if you combine them with lists?

Then, write down a question. It can be a point of confusion or a needed clarification about anything in the readings, or
it can be something interesting that you thought about while you were reading that goes beyond the reading. Or it can be
an example you thought about, or a connection you made between the concepts here and other parts of your life. But write
down a good question or example based on what you were thinking about while reading.
