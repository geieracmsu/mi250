Today is election day; there is no class today. If you are eligible to vote in the U.S., please go vote! If you're not sure how/where to vote or whether you're registered, [MSUvote](https://msuvote.msu.edu/){:target="_blank"} is a great resource.

The Summary + Question for this week will not be due until Thursday Nov 7 before the start of class.
