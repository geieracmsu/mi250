Today is an introduction to the course and a discussion of what programming is.  There is no lab or studio work for today.

Point again to the syllabus, and to the readings page for this week.

If I use slides to introduce the class, embed them here.

Point to:
* syllabus
* what's on D2L
* what's on the course website
* intro to python?

Instructions here for who this class is suited for and what to do if you don't think it's the right class for you.
