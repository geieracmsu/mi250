Each week, students will need to turn in screenshots of the work they've done in class. The best times to take screenshots are:
* For labs: after each completed exercise
* For studios: at the end of the studio

Screenshots should show the code working. If it's just code, take a screenshot of the code running successfully in command line (Terminal on Mac or Powershell on Windows). If it's visual (using Turtle), take a screenshot of the turtle window after the code has drawn.

## Mac OS

Full screen: cmd + shift + 3
Your screen will flash and the screenshot will automatically save.

Portion of screen: cmd + shift + 5
Your cursor will look like a crosshair. Click and drag your mouse to select the part of the screen you want to screenshot. When you let go, the screenshot will save.

Screenshots usually save to the desktop.

## Windows 

Full screen: Windows key + Print Screen (PrtScn)
Your screen will flash and the screenshot will automatically save.

Portion of screen: open the built-in Snipping Tool with Windows key + Shift + S. Your screen will go dark and your cursor will look like a plus sign (+). Click and drag your mouse to select the part of the screen you want to capture.

Screenshots usually save to Pictures -> Screenshots. 

You can also use the Snipping Tool to take full screen screenshots, to annotate screenshots, and to specify where you want your screenshot to be saved. Search for "snipping tool" using the search bar next to the Windows logo to find and open the application.
