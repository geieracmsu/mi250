This course uses D2L and Gitlab for turning in work. Almost every week, students will be responsible for three turn-ins:
* Homework (individual)
* Code and screenshots for labs (partners)
* Code and screenshots for studios (group)

## Homework

Every week, you will have a small amount of homework. Homework consists of:
1. completing readings (articles and/or videos)
2. responding to what you've read / watched

Readings for each week are located on the [schedule]({% link schedule.md %}) in the 'readings' column. They shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to go through each week.

Responses take the form of a summary+question, to be turned in each week under 'Quizzes' on [D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. They have two parts:
* Summary: follow the prompt on the readings page for that week to summarize what you've read
* Question: ask a question about what you've read
See the syllabus[link] for more details.

Make sure to turn this in before the first class of each week.

## Code and screenshots for labs

Every week, usually on Tuesdays, we'll have a lab. Labs are done in pairs. At least one person in each pair will need to turn in:
* screenshots showing code working
* code

Screenshots are turned in on D2L under 'assignments'.

Starting in week 3, code is turned in on Gitlab. Both partners should be members of the Gitlab repository for the lab.

### Using Gitlab for labs

Each lab will have a
