You'll be using command line a lot in this class to run Python programs. Here are some tips and tricks to help you out.

Navigate to a folder
- plus drag and drop shortcut

Find out what's in the folder you're in

Find out what the current folder is (what folder command line thinks it's in)

Get out of Python's interactive mode

Get out of VIM on Terminal

Up arrow to autopopulate previous commands

To learn more about this, you can read about [Navigating the Command Line](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html) 
(which I recommend if you haven't worked with the command line before).

More information about these shell commands can be found
[here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference).
