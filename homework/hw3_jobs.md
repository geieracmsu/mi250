This is a short research and writing assignment. The purpose of this assignment is for you to reflect on how programming might fit into your future.

## Instructions:

Find a job posting for a job you would like to have someday in the future. You don't have to be qualified for the job. Some good places to look for job postings are Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn. [Handshake](https://careernetwork.msu.edu/resources/handshake/){:target="_blank"} is also a useful, MSU-specific resource. There are also a lot of useful resources on the [ComArtSci career center website](https://comartsci.msu.edu/student-experience/career-center/career-center-resources){:target="_blank"}. Save the link to the job posting to copy into your assignment.

Now, write a 2-3 paragraph reflection about the job posting you found:

1.	Summarize: write 1 paragraph summarizing the job posting. For example, what is the job title, what company/organization is it for, what are the main responsibilities for the job, what skills (if any) are required or recommended, etc. Pay special attention to the details that are interesting to you personally.

2.	Reflect: write 1-2 paragraphs reflecting on how programming might (or might not) be a useful skill if you were to apply to this job. Think not only about what the responsibilities of the job are, but also what kinds of people you might be working with. Also think about whether a knowledge of programming would make some aspects of the job easier.

Please turn in your reflection in on D2L either as a Word doc or a PDF. Include the link to the job posting somewhere in the document you turn in.
